<p>Measurements of masses, volumes, and preparation of chemical solutions of known composition are essential laboratory skills. The goal of this exercise is to gain familiarity with these laboratory procedures. You will use these skills repeatedly throughout the semester.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="theory">
<span id="heading-laboratory-measurements-and-procedures-theory"></span><h2>Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many laboratory procedures require preparation of chemical solutions. Most chemical solutions are prepared on the basis of mass of solute per volume of solution (grams per liter or moles per liter). Preparation of these chemical solutions requires the ability to accurately measure both mass and volume.</p>
<p>Preparation of dilutions is also frequently required. Many analytical techniques require the preparation of known standards. Standards are generally prepared with concentrations similar to that of the samples being analyzed. In environmental work many of the analyses are for hazardous substances at very low concentrations (mg/L or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu g/L\)</span> levels). It is difficult to accurately weigh a few milligrams of a chemical with an analytical balance. Often dry chemicals are in crystalline or granular form with each crystal weighing several milligrams making it difficult to get close to the desired weight. Thus it is often easier to prepare a low concentration standard by diluting a higher concentration stock solution. For example, 100 mL of a 10 mg/L solution of NaCl could be obtained by first preparing a 1 g/L NaCl solution (100 mg in 100 mL). One mL of the 1 g/L stock solution would then be diluted to 100 mL to obtain a 10 mg/L solution.</p>
<p>Absorption spectroscopy is one analytical technique that can be used to measure the concentration of a compound. Solutions that are colored absorb light in the visible range. The resulting color of the solution is from the light that is transmitted. According to Beer’s law the attenuation of light in a chemical solution is related to the concentration and the length of the path that the light passes through.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-fund-attenuation">
<span class="eqno">(1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-fund-attenuation" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\log \left(\frac{P_o }{P} \right)=\varepsilon bc\]</div>
<p>where c is the concentration of the chemical species, b is the distance the light travels through the solution, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is a constant, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_o\)</span> is the intensity of the incident light, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> is the intensity of the transmitted light. Absorption, A, is defined as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-fund-abs-of-attenuation">
<span class="eqno">(2)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-fund-abs-of-attenuation" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[A=\log \left(\frac{P_{o} }{P} \right)\]</div>
<p>In practice <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_0\)</span> is the intensity of light through a reference sample (such as deionized water) and thus accounts for any losses in the walls of the sample chamber. From equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-fund-attenuation">(1)</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-fund-abs-of-attenuation">(2)</a> it may be seen that absorption is directly proportional to the concentration of the chemical species.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 2 </span><span class="caption-text">Diagram of light path in diode array spectrophotometer</span></p>
</div>
<p>One instrument you may use to measure absorbance is a Hewlett Packard (HP) model 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The diode array spectrophotometer uses a broad-spectrum source of incident light from a deuterium lamp. The light passes through the sample, 1 cm path length, and is split by a grating into a spectrum of light that is measured by an array of diodes. Each diode measures a bandwidth of 2 nm with 316 diodes covering the range from 190 nm to 820 nm. The wavelengths of light and their colors are given in Table 2- #. The light path for the diode array spectrophotometer is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-spectrophotometer"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2</span></a>.</p>
<p>The HP 8452A spectrophotometer has a photometric range of 0.002 - 3.3 absorbance units. In practice absorbance measurements greater than 2.5 are not very meaningful as they indicate that 99.7% of the incident light at that wavelength was absorbed. Conversely, an absorbance of 0.002 means that 0.5% of the incident light at that wavelength was absorbed.</p>

<h3>Mass Measurements<a class="headerlink" href="#mass-measurements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mass can be accurately measured with an electronic analytical balance. Perhaps because balances are so easy to use it is easy to forget that they should be calibrated on a regular basis. It is recommended that balances be calibrated once a week, after the balance has been moved, or if excessive temperature variations have occurred. In order for balances to operate correctly they also need to be level. Most balances come with a bubble level and adjustable feet. Before calibrating a balance verify that the balance is level.</p>
<p>The environmental laboratory is equipped with 200 g balances.  As part of this exercise, we will calibrate the 200 g as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Start with the balance off.</li>
<li>Press and hold the ON/ZERO key until the screen reads ‘MENU’.</li>
<li>Releasing the ON/ZERO key will take you to calibration mode indicated by ‘.C.A.L.’ on the screen.</li>
<li>Press the ON/ZERO key to indicate ‘Yes’ to calibration.</li>
<li>The balance will acquire the zero value (and read – C -).</li>
<li>Once the zero value is obtained, the balance screen will blink – 200 g – indicating that the 200 g mass will be used for the calibration.</li>
<li>Place the 200 g calibration mass on the pan (handle the calibration mass using a cotton glove or tissue paper) and press ON/ZERO key.</li>
<li>The balance will calibrate to the mass added. Remove the mass when the screen reads ‘200.00 g’ indicating the calibration is complete.</li>
<li>Measure the mass of a second calibration mass of different size (e.g., 100 g) to confirm calibration.</li>
<li>Record relevant data in the attached spreadsheet.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Dry chemicals can be weighed in disposable plastic “weighing boats” or other suitable containers. It is often desirable to subtract the weight of the container in which the chemical is being weighed. The weight of the chemical can be obtained either by weighing the container first and then subtracting, or by “zeroing” the balance with the container on the balance.</p>

<h3>Temperature Measurement and ProCoDA<a class="headerlink" href="#temperature-measurement-and-procoda" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will use a data acquisition system designed and fabricated in CEE at Cornell University. Each group has their own ProCoDA box and associated power supply and USB cable. The power supply and USB cable must be plugged into the ProCoDA box and then into the AC power on your lab bench and a USB port on your lab bench computer, respectively.</p>
<p>Use a thermistor to measure the temperature of distilled water. The thermistors are usually hanging on the rack to the right of the fume hoods (you should have one on your bench today). The thermistor has a 4-mm diameter metallic probe. Plug the thermistor into the red signal-conditioning box. The conditioned signal is connected to the ProCoDA box using a red cable. Connect the red cable to one of the sensor ports on the top row of the ProCoDA box.</p>

<li>Did you use interpolation or extrapolation to get the concentration of the unknown?</li>
<li>What measurement controls the accuracy of the density measurement for the NaCl solution?</li>
<li>What density did you expect (see prelab 2)?</li>
<li>Approximately what should the accuracy be?</li>
<li>Don’t forget to write a brief paragraph on conclusions and on suggestions using Markdown.</li>
<li>Verify that your report and graphs meet the requirements as outlined in the course materials.</li>
