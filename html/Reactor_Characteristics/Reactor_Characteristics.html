<p>Chemical, biological, and physical processes in nature and in engineered systems usually take place in what we call “reactors.” Reactors are defined by a real or imaginary boundary that physically confines the processes. Lakes, segments of a river, and settling tanks in treatment plants are examples of reactors. Most, but not all, reactors experience continuous flow (in and out). Sequencing batch reactors have a sequence of states including fill, react, and empty. It is important to know the mixing level and residence time in reactors, since they both affect the degree of process reaction that occurs while the fluid (usually water) and its components (often pollutants) pass through the reactor.</p>
<p>Chlorine contactor tanks are designed to maximize the contact time between chlorine and pathogens before the water is delivered to consumers. Thus the design objective is to maximize the time that it takes for water to travel from the tank influent to the effluent. Tracer studies can be used to determine the hydraulic characteristics of a reactor such as the disinfection contact tanks at water treatment plants. The results from tracer studies are used to obtain accurate estimates of the effective contact time. In this laboratory students will experiment with different reactor designs with the goal of maximizing the contact time.</p>

<h3>Dispersion<a class="headerlink" href="#dispersion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mixing levels give rise to three categories of reactors; completely mixed flow reactors (CMFR), plug flow reactors (PFR) and flow with dispersion reactors (FDR). The plug flow reactor is an idealized extreme not attainable in practice. All real reactors fall under the category of FDR or CMFR.</p>

<div class="section" id="boundary-conditions">
<h3>Boundary Conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#boundary-conditions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The reactor inlet and outlet boundary conditions significantly affect the reactor response to the addition of a pulse of tracer. If dispersion is possible across a boundary, then the boundary is open. An example of a reactor with open boundaries is a section of a river. If a tracer is added to a section of a river it is possible for some of the tracer to move upstream, illustrating that an arbitrary section of a river is an open reactor (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-open-boundaries"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8</span></a>). This is equivalent to letting the reactor be defined as a section of a long reactor. One of the characteristics of open boundaries is that some of the tracer introduced at the reactor inlet can be carried upstream and thus the residence time for a conservative tracer can be greater than the hydraulic residence time!</p>

<p>A closed reactor is one where the reactor has a diffusion or dispersion coefficient different than those of the entrance or exit (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-closed-boundaries"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 9</span></a>).  Typically exit and entrance diffusion/dispersion are much less than the diffusion/dispersion in the reactor. An example of a reactor with closed boundaries is a tank with small inlet and outlet pipes.</p>

<p>Reactors can be studied by measuring the effluent concentration after the addition of a spike or pulse of a tracer in the influent or after a step function change in input concentration. The resulting response curves can be made non-dimensional by plotting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{C_t{\rlap{-} V }_r}{C_{tr}{\rlap{-} V }_{tr}}\)</span> as a function of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({t/\theta}\)</span>. where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is the hydraulic residence time.

<h3>Completely Mixed Flow Reactor<a class="headerlink" href="#completely-mixed-flow-reactor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Completely mixed flow regimes can be approximated quite closely in practice. In the case of CMFRs, there is not an analytical solution to the advection-dispersion equation so we revert to a simple mass balance. For a completely mixed reactor a mass balance on a conservative tracer yields the following differential equation:</p>

<p>where Q is the volumetric flow rate and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rlap{-} V_r\)</span> is the volume of the reactor.</p>
<p>Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-reactor-mass-balance">(52)</a> can be used to predict a variety of effluent responses to tracer inputs. If a pulse of tracer is discharged directly into a reactor so that the initial concentration of tracer in the reactor is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{0} =\frac{C_{tr} \rlap{-} V _{tr} }{\rlap{-} V _{r} }\)</span> and the input concentration is zero (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{in} = 0\)</span>) the solution to the differential equation is:</p>

<h3>Plug Flow Reactor<a class="headerlink" href="#plug-flow-reactor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Plug flow regimes are impossible to attain because mass transport must be by advection alone. There can be no differential displacement of tracer relative to the average advective velocity. In practice some mixing will occur due to molecular diffusion, turbulent dispersion, and/or fluid shear. For the case of the plug flow reactor the advection-dispersion equation in 1.7 reduces to:</p>

<p>The velocity, U, serves to transform the directional concentration gradient into a temporal concentration gradient. In other words, a conservative substance moves with the advective flow of the fluid. The solutions to this differential equation for a pulse input and for a step input are shown graphically in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-pfr-pulse-step"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 11</span></a>.

<h3>Flow with Dispersion<a class="headerlink" href="#flow-with-dispersion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Real flow reactors that aren’t completely mixed exhibit behavior that is between plug flow and completely mixed. The reactor flow behavior is a function of the relative strength of the mixing process (or dispersion) compared to the advective flow. Analytical solutions that describe these real reactors are more difficult and in most cases a parameter describing the dispersion is fit to the data rather than predicted <em>a priori</em>. Two models for arbitrary mixing levels are described below.</p>

<h3>Closed Boundary Conditions: Completely Mixed Flow Reactor in Series<a class="headerlink" href="#closed-boundary-conditions-completely-mixed-flow-reactor-in-series" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Completely mixed flow reactors are sometimes connected in series to create a reactor system with flow characteristics in between CMFR and PFR. CMFRs in series increase overall process efficiency because the reactants are at higher concentrations in the first reactors than they would be in a single large CMFR. Thus the total reactor volume can be smaller with a series of CMFRs. Similarly the reaction process can be made more efficient given the same reactor volume if it is divided into a series of CMFRs.</p>
<p>Non ideal reactors with mixing levels between that of CMFRs and PFRs and reactors containing baffles can also be modeled as a series of CMFRs. In this case the mixing level for the system is represented by the number of CMFRs that are used to represent the non-ideal reactor.

<p>One of the easiest methods to determine the mixing (dispersion) characteristics of a reactor is to add a spike input of a conservative material and then monitor the concentration of the material in the reactor effluent. The equations below can be used to analyze the data and extract the mixing characteristics of the reactor. One of the challenges of using the equations below is that they require collecting data long enough to get all of the tracer. This is generally not practical and the tracer concentration measurements are challenging as the tracer approaches background levels or the measurement detection limit. For this laboratory exercise we will fit the acquired data to the models. We will collect until most of the tracer has left the reactor or approximately 2 hydraulic residence times.</p>
<p>The equations below are included for completeness with the caveat that they require collecting data until the tracer concentration is negligible.</p>
<p>The variance of tracer concentration versus time (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma _{t}^{2}\)</span>, with dimensions of time squared) can be measured by sampling at a single point in the reactor at many different times and can be computed using the following equations.</p>

<p>Inlet and outlet boundary conditions affect the response obtained from a reactor. Closed reactors have little dispersion across their inlet and outlet boundaries whereas open reactors can have significant dispersion across their inlet and outlet boundaries. Typically open systems have no physical boundaries in the direction of flow. An example of an open system would be a river segment. Closed systems have small inlets and outlets that minimize dispersion across the inlet and outlet regions. An example of a closed system is a tank (or a lake) with a small inlet and outlet. The reactor used in the lab is closed. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{t}\)</span> in equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-reactor-tbar">(73)</a> is the measured average residence time for the tracer in the reactor. For ideal closed reactors the measured residence time, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{t}\)</span>, is equal to the theoretical hydraulic residence time (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> = reactor volume/flow rate). For open reactors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{t}\)</span> can exceed the hydraulic residence time. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{t}\)</span> is less than the hydraulic residence time it may indicate that the reactor contains “dead volume” or “short circuiting” such that some volume of the reactor is effectively unused.</p>
<p>The above equations suggest that from the reactor response to a spike input we can compute the dispersion coefficient for the reactor. We have two options for measuring reactor response:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>synoptic measurements: at a fixed time sampling many points along the axis of the reactor will yield a Gaussian curve of concentration vs. distance.

<li>single point sampling: measure the concentration at a fixed position along the x axis of the reactor for many times. If the reactor length is fixed at L and measurements are made at the effluent of the reactor (observe the concentration of a tracer at x = L as a function of time) then x is no longer a variable and C(x,t) becomes C(t) only. The response curve obtained through single point sampling is skewed. The curve spread changes during the sampling period and the response curve is skewed.</li>

<p>A conservative tracer will be used to characterize your reactors. Typical tracers include salt and various dyes. For this experiment we will use #40 Red Dye as the conservative tracer. The red dye concentration will be measured using an optical spectrophotometric probe. The linear range of operation for the probes is from about 0.01 mg/L to 30 mg/L. We will add an amount of red dye near the high end of this range to acquire a dataset that spans multiple orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Additional constraints for the tracer are that if a highly concentrated tracer is used, then there will be a significant density difference between the tracer and the water in the reactor. If a very dilute tracer is used then a large volume of tracer will need to be added and the volume of tracer could become a large fraction of the reactor volume and thus the pulse could no longer be modeled as having negligible volume.</p>
<p>The reactors are 30 cm long and 15 cm wide. If the depth is limited to (a maximum of) 5 cm, then the total volume is 2.25 L and with a peristaltic pumping rate of approximately 380 mL/min, the residence time is approximately 6 minutes.</p>
<p>The tracer should be added directly by pipette into the first chamber of your reactor. The red dye will also make it possible to qualitatively observe the advective and dispersive transport in the reactors.</p>

<p>In these experiments, we will be pumping tap water from a 20 L Jerrican to the influent of your reactor.

<p>Use a second pump head with #17 tubing to pull a sample from near the effluent weir through the photometer and then to the drain.</p>
<p>Before running an experiment, it is important to determine whether your setup works. Turn the pump to approximately 380 mL/min (100 rpm) and get water flowing through the system and off to waste. Two important things to check:</p>

<p>For each test make sure that you accurately measure the reactor volume, residual reactor red dye concentration, and the flow rate. The reactor volume can be approximated by taking the mass of the reactor, as you did to estimate the volume of your lakes.  Measure the residual concentration of red dye in the reactor by measuring the completely mixed concentration (this is just the concentration at the end of the experiment for the CMFR, but you will have to remove the baffles and mix for the baffled reactors). The flow rate can be accurately determined by measuring the volume of a timed sample from the pump.</p>

This will make it possible to do a post experiment recalibration of the photometer if necessary.</li>

<h3>Baffle Design<a class="headerlink" href="#baffle-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Baffles can be added to tanks to decrease the ability of the solution to travel quickly from the tank inlet to the tank outlet. The goal of the baffle design depends on whether the tank is designed for a reaction or for separation. The baffles in reactors should generally be designed to achieve mixing in each of the baffled zones. The baffles in tanks designed for separation (clarifiers) should be designed to achieve uniform flow (a much more difficult goal to achieve). Mixing within each baffled zone could be achieved with a propeller mixer or by appropriately sized pores in the baffles. If pore mixing is desired the energy for mixing is provided by the kinetic energy of the fluid flowing through the pores.</p>
<p>The flow characteristics of a baffled tank are complex and would require computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model. In lieu of developing a CFD model we will turn to dimensional analysis to help us characterize the mixing efficiency of a baffled reactor segment. The independent parameter that we will measure to characterize the reactor is its Peclet number or the number of N CMFRs in series.</p>
<p>The design goal is to determine the diameter and spacing of the pores required to achieve adequate mixing. The fluid flow out of the pores is jet flow. The jets entrain and mix with the surrounding fluid. To develop effective mixing the jet should be turbulent. The transition between turbulent and laminar behavior for jets occurs at a jet Reynolds number of a few hundred (Personal communication with Dr. Cowen).</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-reactor-characteristics-reactor-characteristics-14">
<span class="eqno">(80)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-reactor-characteristics-reactor-characteristics-14" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}Re_{jet} =\frac{V_{jet} d_{jet} }{\nu }\\Re_{jet} =\frac{4Q_{jet} }{\pi d_{jet} \nu }\\Re_{jet} =\frac{4Q_{reactor} }{n_{ports} \pi d_{jet} \nu }\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>The optimal pore spacing for maximum mixing could be based on the spread of the jet in the distance to the next baffle.  Jets expand in the radial direction at a rate of approximately 10% of the distance the jet travels axially. Thus the pore spacing could be in a rectangular grid with the distance between pores equal to 10% of the distance between baffles. This spacing may be smaller than practical since it will require a large number of pores.</p>
<p>An additional constraint on pore design is that the head loss through the pores not be excessive. The hydraulic grade line (and thus depth of each baffled reactor) will drop by a distance equal to the head loss through the pores. The head loss through the pores is given by the orifice equation</p>

<h3>Chlorine Contact Tank Design<a class="headerlink" href="#chlorine-contact-tank-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The design objective for chlorine contact tanks is to maximize the inactivation of pathogens by maximizing the contact time between the chlorine and the pathogens before the water is sent to the distribution system. This objective has been codified by the EPA with the contact time for a tank defined as the time for the effluent of the tank to reach 10% of the influent value after a step change in the influent.</p>
