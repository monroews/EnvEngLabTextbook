<p>Water is sometimes called the universal solvent and that property has both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, water’s ability to serve as a carrier for many compounds is essential for life. On the negative side that same ability can result in water carrying substances that are harmful to life. Environmental engineers often have the challenge of removing harmful dissolved species from water. This task shows up when we are producing safe drinking water from a ground water source that is contaminated with arsenic, fluoride, nitrate, or atrazine. Surface water sources can be contaminated with naturally organic matter that interacts with disinfectants to produce toxic by products. Wastewater reuse requires removal of a long list of dissolved species that would otherwise accumulate. Dyeing of clothing produces an industrial waste water contaminated with high concentrations of dissolved dyes. As we develop improved analytical techniques we realize that many of the substances that we use including caffeine, cocaine, pharmaceuticals, herbicides, and pesticides are present in the environment.</p>
<p>Our strategies for removing dissolved species are limited to stopping the manufacture and use of the harmful compounds, encouraging reactions to transform the compounds into less harmful products, or removing the compounds from water. Of course, removing the compounds from water requires that we put the compounds somewhere else. We can either concentrate the compounds in water (reverse osmosis) or transfer the compounds into a gas (air stripping) or solid phase (adsorption).</p>
<p>Adsorption to a solid phase is commonly used in drinking water treatment plants. Aluminum and iron hydroxide coagulant nanoparticles are used for flocculation because they are sticky and readily attach to suspended particles. The coagulant nanoparticles also adsorb many dissolves species including naturally occurring dissolved organics. The coagulant nanoparticles are then concentrated in the solid phase of the sludge produced by water treatment plants. Activated carbon is also used in drinking water treatment to transfer dissolved species to the solid phase. This laboratory experiment will give us an opportunity to learn about the removal of dissolved species through adsorption to a solid phase.</p>

<p>Adsorption is a unit operation in which surface-active materials in true solution are removed from the solvent by interphase transfer to the surface of an adsorbent particle. This process is employed in environmental engineering practice for removal of various pollutants such as soluble organics, dyes, pesticides, humic substances, etc., from wastewaters and for removal of color, taste, and odor-producing compounds from natural waters that are to be used as potable water supplies. Adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC) also finds wide application in the remediation of groundwater contaminated with volatile and nonvolatile organic pollutants.</p>
<p>Under isothermal conditions the equilibrium partitioning between solution and solid phase is a function of concentration. In this experiment the partitioning will be analyzed using both Freundlich</p>

<p>We will preload columns of sand (or glass beads) with the adsorbent and then pump a solution of red dye #40 through the column. We will measure the effluent concentration of the dye as a function of time using a photometer. In these experiments the column of sand is inert, but provides a mechanism to hold the adsorbent stationary (fixed bed) while the red dye solution flows through. The red dye will adsorb to the adsorbent and the effluent red dye concentration is expected to be very low for some time. Red dye will begin breaking through once the majority of the adsorbent reaches equilibrium with the influent concentration of the red dye.</p>
<p>In this analysis we are neglecting several aspects of the adsorption process. We assume that the time required to reach equilibrium partitioning is very small relative to the hydraulic residence time, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_{HRT}\)</span>, of the column. This assumption requires that both liquid phase and solid phase adsorbate mass transport mechanisms are relatively fast. Transport within the solid phase matrix of an activated carbon granule is by the slow process of diffusion. Thus we expect diffusion to increase the time required to reach equilibrium for adsorbents that require diffusion over longer distances. Diffusion time will be greatest for Large diameter granular activated carbon, less for powdered activated carbon, and very fast for coagulant nanoparticles.</p>

<p>The velocity of the mass transfer zone (mtz or the adsorption front) can be obtained by a mass balance on the system. If we set our frame of reference (and our control volume) to be centered on the mass transfer zone, then the average velocity (over the pore fraction of the control surface) of fluid entering the mtz is equal to pore water velocity minus the velocity of the mtz. The fluid phase concentration of the adsorbate entering the control surface is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_0\)</span> and the fraction of the control surface where fluid is passing through is the porosity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span>.</p>
<p>The average velocity of the solid phase exiting through the control surface is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-v_{mtz}\)</span>. The bulk density of the adsorbate is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_0 \rho_{bulk \; adsorbent}\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{bulk \; adsorbent}\)</span> is the mass of adsorbent per volume of the packed bed. The mass rate of adsorbate passing through the control surface in liquid phase must precisely balance the mass rate of adsorbate passing through the control surface in the solid phase because the mtz is stationary.</p>

<p>From experiments conducted in the Cornell environmental laboratory around 2003 we have  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_{50 mg/L}\)</span> = 0.08. Our goal is to design a fixed bed reactor that has a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{mtz}\)</span> of about 30 minutes. With a 15 cm deep column at 1 mm/s and with a porosity of 0.4 the hydraulic residence time is 1 minute. Given a target retardation factor of 30 we can calculate the bulk density of carbon that we should have in the column. We can achieve this bulk density by diluting the activated carbon with sand.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting and Reflections<a class="headerlink" href="#troubleshooting-and-reflections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Spring 2019 is the first time that we are including this experiment. There are always multiple challenges associated with developing a new laboratory experiment and in this case it is possible to anticipate several potential problems with this experimental design.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Air bubbles! Air in the sand column or in the photometer will result in failure. Surface tension makes it difficult to remove the air bubbles from the activated carbon. The methods may need to be modified if air causes problems.</li>
<li>Mass transport of the red dye into the activated carbon pores is slow because it is a diffusion process. It is possible that this will result in premature breakthrough of red dye long before the activated carbon reaches equilibrium with the influent concentration of red dye.</li>
<li>The relatively small amount of activated carbon in the sand column may result in inefficient transport of the red dye to the activated carbon granules. This would also result in inefficient removal of red dye.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>An alternative to granular activated carbon is Poly aluminum chloride (PACl - not to be confused with Powdered Activated Carbon or PAC). PACl will remove red dye by adsorption and given that PACl forms nanoparticles (rather than millimeter sized granules for GAC) it is possible that the mass transport of red dye to PACl will be much faster mass transport of red dye to GAC. This could be tested by substituting PACl for GAC in the column. We would need to develop a method to deliver the PACl flocs to the sand column.</p>

<h3>Contactor Results and Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#contactor-results-and-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
